I want a React PWA to help me with shopping

It will have three main functions

1) Managing the catalog of purchaseable items
- each item has the following features
 - one or more names (entered separated by spaces, names do not contain a space)
 - an item type (e.g. veg, dairy, household, ..
- i want to be able to define new items, and also new item types


2) Creating the current shopping list
 - add item to list
   - use a autocomplete over the catalog, using any of the names of the item,  to reduce necessary input 
 - delete item from list


3) Supporting the shopping process
 - display list
 - set status of item (for ticking off the items while i am shopping)
